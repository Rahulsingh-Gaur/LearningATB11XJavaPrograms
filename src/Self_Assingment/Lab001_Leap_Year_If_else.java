public class Lab001_Turnary_Operater_Leap_year {
//    Objective: Write a Java program to check if a given year is a leap year using a nested ternary operator.
//Task:
//    Take a year as input from the user.
//    Use a nested ternary operator to determine if the year is a leap year based on the following rules:
//    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
//    However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
//    Print whether the year is a leap year or not.
